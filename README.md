# SMART-WATER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-FOR-EFFICIENT-DISTRIBUTION-
This project develops an IoT-based Smart Water Management System that monitors flow, pressure, and quality in real time. It detects leaks, forecasts demand, and automates control for efficient distribution. The system reduces water loss, improves efficiency, and supports sustainable water use in both urban and rural areas.
